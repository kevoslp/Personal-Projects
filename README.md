#### Simple Beginner Level Personal Projects
-------------------------------
First project (GUI.java) was a simple GUI to get used to Java's J features. 

Second project (CatTicTacToe.java) was making a TicTacToe game but used cat photos instead of X's and O's. This proved to be more challenging than regular Tic-Tac-Toe.
